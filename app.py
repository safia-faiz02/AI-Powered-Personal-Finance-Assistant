        Your responses should be:
        - Clear, concise, and user-friendly.

    4. Calculate savings as the difference between income and total expenses.
    5. Identify any unnecessary or excessive purchases that deviate from usual spending patterns.
    6. Apply zero-based budgeting to optimize fund allocation and ensure every dollar is assigned purposefully.
    7. Use predictive analytics to anticipate future expenses and potential financial risks.`
